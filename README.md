# Victor Lopez — Senior Software Engineer (.NET / Azure)

Senior Software Engineer and Technical Leader with strong architectural ownership in distributed systems and enterprise modernization.

I design and implement scalable microservices architectures, evolve complex .NET Framework legacy platforms, and build production-ready SaaS systems with a focus on clarity, maintainability, and long-term sustainability.

## 🔹 Architecture & Distributed Systems

Hands-on experience designing and implementing independently deployable microservices:

- Domain analysis and bounded context definition
- Service boundary design based on business capabilities
- Independent deployment and lifecycle management
- Synchronous vs asynchronous communication modeling
- Event-driven choreography and orchestration
- Idempotent message processing (message ID validation)
- Eventual consistency strategies
- Retry policies and failure handling in distributed environments
- Production support and root cause analysis (RCA)

I focus on pragmatic architecture — balancing theoretical correctness with real-world operational constraints.

## 🔹 Legacy System Modernization (.NET Framework)

Strong background working with large enterprise systems built on .NET Framework:

- Incremental migration strategies (Strangler pattern)
- Domain isolation before service extraction
- Controlled module-by-module refactoring
- Introducing Clean Architecture principles into legacy codebases
- Performance optimization in mature production systems
- Technical debt reduction without business disruption

Modernization is treated as a strategic evolution, not a rewrite.

## 🔹 Technical Leadership

- Architectural decision-making and trade-off analysis
- Monolith vs microservices evaluation
- Definition of coding standards and design guidelines
- Migration planning and execution
- Alignment between business requirements and scalable system design
- Mentoring engineers in distributed system concepts

## 🔹 Teaching & Knowledge Sharing

Facilitator of a .NET Microservices Architecture course.

I guide engineers through:

- Domain boundary identification
- Microservice communication models
- Event-driven consistency patterns
- Production-ready architectural decisions
- Distributed system failure scenarios

The focus is always practical: architecture that survives production.

## 🔹 AI-Enhanced Engineering Workflow

I integrate AI-assisted development tools into real engineering workflows:

- Cursor IA for large codebase navigation and refactoring
- Windsurf for deep contextual analysis across services
- VS Code + Codex/Copilot for scaffolding and productivity acceleration

AI is used as a productivity amplifier — not as a substitute for architectural thinking.
